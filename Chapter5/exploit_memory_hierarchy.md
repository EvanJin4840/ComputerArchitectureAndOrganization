- 개념적 이름 : Instruction Memory (명령어 메모리)
  "CPU가 명령어를 가져오는 논리적인 장소"
- 물리적 실체 : Instruction Cache (실제로 그 역할을 하는 것) + Main Memory (캐시에 없을 때)

### Instruction Cache (I-Cache)

- Definition: A cache dedicated solely to storing the executable machine code (instructions) of the program (e.g., ADD, JUMP, LOAD).
- Pipeline Stage: Accessed during the IF (Instruction Fetch) stage.
- Access Frequency: 100% (1.0).
  Since every instruction must be fetched to be executed, the CPU accesses the I-Cache in every single cycle (unless stalled).

* Characteristics

- Read-Only: Programs typically do not modify their own code during execution, so the CPU only reads from here.
- High Spatial Locality: Instructions are usually executed sequentially (address $N, N+4, N+8...$), making prefetching very effective.

### Data Cache (D-Cache)

- Definition: A cache dedicated to storing the data variables used by the program (e.g., integers, arrays, structures, stack/heap data).
- Pipeline Stage: Accessed during the MEM (Memory Access) stage.

- Access Frequency: Variable (e.g., ~30-40%).

The CPU accesses this cache only when executing memory-related instructions like Load (LW) or Store (SW). Arithmetic instructions (like ADD, SUB) do not access the D-Cache.

This is why we multiply by the memory access frequency (e.g., 0.36) when calculating D-Cache stalls.

- Characteristics

* Read & Write: Data is frequently updated, so this cache must handle both read and write operations efficiently.
